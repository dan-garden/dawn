# Wordpress Dawn


## Introduction


## Roadmap


### Goal
I want to create a bundled package to simplify the process of creating a new headless wordpress site from mockup.

### Desired Features
- Storybook implementation to visually test individual components of the website
- Statically generated, paired with dynamic data fetching
- A well structured process with a guide to follow from start to finish

## Technologies

  - Yarn instead of NPM for dependency management
  - Next.JS (SSG Wordpress Bundle)
  - Apollo GraphQL for dynamic data fetching
  - CSS library (like Tailwind) for styling

- Wordpress Plugins
  - Dawn Core
  - Advanced Custom Fields
  - Advanced Custom Fields PRO
  - Classic Editor
  - Custom Post Type UI
  - WP GraphQL
  - WPGraphQL for ACF
  - Yoast Duplicate Post
